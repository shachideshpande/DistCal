## Distribution Calibration with TorchUQ

> We extend TorchUQ, an extensive library for uncertainty quantification (UQ) based on pytorch, to implement distribution calibration
> TorchUQ currently supports 10 representations for uncertainty, and around 50 different methods for uncertainty evaluation and visualization, calibration and conformal prediction. 




## Installation 

To run the code, you can install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f env_nobuilds.yml
```
